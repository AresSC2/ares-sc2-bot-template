# ares-sc2-starter-bot

[Documentation](https://aressc2.github.io/ares-sc2/index.html)

## Installation:
Prerequisites, ensure these are installed before proceeding:
- Python 3.11 
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Starcraft 2](https://starcraft2.com/en-gb/)
- [Maps](https://sc2ai.net/wiki/maps/)

### Setup
If you have a non-standard starcraft installation or are using Linux, please adjust `MAPS_PATH` in `run.py`.

Click the `Use this template` button to create a new repo based on this template.

Then clone the repo, don't forget `--recursive`:

`git clone --recursive <git_repo_url_here>`

Change into your bot's directory:

`cd <bot_folder>`

Install - this will install dependencies, compile cython, and create a new isolated virtual environment:

`poetry install`

#### Run:

Optionally set your bot name and race in `config.yml`

`poetry run python run.py`

#### Start developing
Open up `bot/main.py` and have fun! 

A `ares-sc2` bot is a [python-sc2](https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2) bot by default, so any examples or
documentation in that repo will be relevant here too.

### PyCharm

#### Adding `poetry` environment
Find the path of the environment `poetry` created in the installation step previously, copy and paste
or save this path somewhere.

`poetry env list --full-path`


Open this project in PyCharm and navigate to:

File | Settings | Project: <project name> | Python Interpreter

 - Click `Add Interpreter`, then `Add Local Interpreter`

 - Select `Poetry Environment`, and choose `Existing Environment`
 - Navigate to the path of the poetry environment from the terminal earlier, and select `Scripts/python.exe`

![Alt text](img/img2.png "a title")

Now when opening terminal in PyCharm, the environment will already be active. New run configurations can be setup,
and they will already be configured to use this environment.


#### Marking sources root
For PyCharm intellisense to work correctly:
 - Right-click `ares-sc2/src` -> Mark Directory as -> Sources Root

## Update `ares-sc2`:
This may take a minute or two

`python update_ares.py`

## Format code:
`black .`

`isort .`


## Activating the build runner
Use the example `protoss_builds.yml` as a starting point, rename this file as necessary for your race. If playing as
Random you will need a separate file for each race you want to use the build runner with. in the `Builds`
section of this file start crafting an OpeningBuildOrder.
